# The algebraic core of the orthogonal refinement certificate

radius eps L n is the paper's d_(n-1): n counts completed bands.
The probabilistic coupling argument supplying hstep in
error_le_radius is NOT assumed to have been formalized by this module.
All results below are theorems about real numbers, not floating-point tests.
